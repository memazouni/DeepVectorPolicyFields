# DeepVectorPolicyFields
This repository is a codebase for Vector Policy Fields using Reinforcement Learning Networks; a framework for learning control policies in continuous state spaces and action space. 

The code in this repository builds off of the paper [Reinforcement Learning via Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02392), and the associated repository [https://github.com/tanmayshankar/RCNN_MDP].
